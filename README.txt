These C++ examples are from a now-retired piece of software. Unfortunately, any recent code of mine would be considered commercially sensitive and not something I could share.

The examples date from around 2006-7 when STL and boost were still relatively new. The examples, although dated, hopefully illustrate that I was trying to make good use of the (then) modern facilities of C++ and using boost to avoid reinventing the wheel. If only there had been a good serialisation library back then!

A great deal of code written by me over the period from 2004 is still in production use at my current employer. One particular system of >20k lines of C++ has been running continuously for a decade (apart from reboots). There are no known bugs or issues with that system.
